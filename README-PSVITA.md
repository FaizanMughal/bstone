bstone-vita
===========

Vita port of BStone. Allowing you to play Blake Stone games natively on that handheld.

Installing and Running
======================

Install the `.vpk`.
Then, in the root of `ux0:/data/bstone/`, place the game assets, which consist, depending on the intended version, of the following files:

| Shareware    | Registered   | Planet Strike |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| AUDIOHED.BS1 | AUDIOHED.BS6 | AUDIOHED.VSI  |
| AUDIOT.BS1   | AUDIOT.BS6   | AUDIOT.VSI    | 
|              | EANIM.BS6    | EANIM.VSI     |
|              | GANIM.BS6    |               |
| IANIM.BS1    | IANIM.BS6    | IANIM.VSI     |
| MAPHEAD.BS1  | MAPHEAD.BS6  | MAPHEAD.VSI   |
| MAPTEMP.BS1  | MAPTEMP.BS6  | MAPTEMP.VSI   |
| SANIM.BS1    | SANIM.BS6    |               |
| VGADICT.BS1  | VGADICT.BS6  | VGADICT.VSI   |
| VGAGRAPH.BS1 | VGAGRAPH.BS6 | VGAGRAPH.VSI  |
| VGAHEAD.BS1  | VGAHEAD.BS6  | VGAHEAD.VSI   |
| VSWAP.BS1    | VSWAP.BS6    | VSWAP.VSI     |

The full versions of Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold and Blake Stone: Planet Strike each can currently be obatined from the 3D Realms website, and additionally from Steam and GOG.

Any combination of these three may coexist in the directory. Press the main "start" region to launch the game. Game version will be chosen in the following order of preference: Registered, Shareware, Planet Strike. Press the "Planet Strike" region to start Planet Strike regardless of the presence of other versions.

## Important note
As of version 0.2, leaving music enabled may lead to intermittent crashing while playing. Set the "Background Music" option in the "Game Settings" menu to "None" in order to prevent this. As with other homebrew on the Vita, pressing the home button or going into sleep mode can lead to unwanted behavior upon returning to the still-running game.
